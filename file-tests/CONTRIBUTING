1) HOW TO ADD NEW FILE INTO DATABASE?
=====================================

Simply send patches to jkaluza@redhat.com. Every file in database has to
follow following rules:

 - Every file 'F' in file-tests database has to have matching 'F.source.txt'
   file with the license information. Only licenses which allows free
   redistribution of the file are allowed. Note that case sensitivity is
   important and must be respected.
 - Every file with extension '.X' has to be in directory 'db/X' according to
   its extension. Note that case sensitivity is important and must be
   respected.

There is simply script called "review-patch.py" which can help you reviewing
that your patch follows these rules.
